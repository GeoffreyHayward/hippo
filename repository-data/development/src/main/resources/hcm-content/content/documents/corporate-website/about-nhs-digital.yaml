            <p>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In order to access certain content, systems or interactive features on this website you may be asked to choose, or be provided with, a password or other log in details to access parts of this website. As a minimum, passwords you set for use with this website must have a level of complexity which ensures they cannot be easily guessed by hackers or malicious software. &nbsp;They should:</p>

            <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;be at least twelve characters long;<br />
            •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;not contain your user name, real name, or organisation name;<br />
            •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;not appear in the list of top 10,000 passwords;<br />
            •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;not use sequential key characters on the keyboard (e.g. qwerty, asdfg, 12345)</p>

            <p>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In line with Government best practice, we recommend using the ‘three random words’ approach, which uses three or more randomly chosen words like ‘saloonbadgertree’ or ‘coffeetrainfish’. &nbsp;These words should be random, and not related personally to you (so not involving a favourite thing, holiday, relative). Passwords must not under any circumstances be shared with anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You may terminate your account registration using the relevant link in your account pages. This will clear any personal information you have saved. Subscriptions to our emails can be terminated using the ‘Unsubscribe’ links provided in the emails. &nbsp;<br />

You warrant that any such contribution does comply with those standards, and you indemnify us for any breach of that warranty.</p>

            <p>9.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any material you upload to this website will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary, and NHS Digital has the right to use, copy, distribute and disclose to third-parties any such material for any purpose.

            <p>9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NHS Digital will not be responsible, or liable to any third-party, for the content or accuracy of any materials posted by your or any other user of this website.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>9.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Comments posted should relate to your personal experience or that of someone close to you. You should not name any individuals (other than yourself) or include information through which someone else could identify an individual about whom you are writing. If you want to comment on someone else’s experience, (e.g. a relative or someone you care for) then you may do so if you ensure that you are not named in the posting and you state how the other person is connected to you (e.g. “my father”). You warrant that all statements of fact in any comment you submit are true, and that any expression of opinion is your honestly held opinion on those facts, or that of the person on whose behalf you are writing.</p>

            <p>9.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you find any comments offensive or objectionable you may make a complaint to the moderator using the ‘Report’ link provided at the foot of each published comment.</p>

            <p>9.7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We have many measures in place to keep your information safe. But it is important that you also play your part – visit the Government's Get Safe Online website for advice on how to do this. &nbsp;<br />

As a minimum, passwords you set for use with this website must have a level of complexity which ensures they cannot be easily guessed by hackers or malicious software. &nbsp;They should:</p>

            <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;be at least twelve characters long;<br />
            •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;not contain your user name, real name, or organisation name;<br />
            •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;not appear in the list of top 10,000 passwords;<br />
            •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;not use sequential key characters on the keyboard (e.g. qwerty, asdfg, 12345)</p>

            <p>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In line with Government best practice, we recommend using the ‘three random words’ approach, which uses three or more randomly chosen words like ‘saloonbadgertree’ or ‘coffeetrainfish’. &nbsp;These words should be random, and not related personally to you (so not involving a favourite thing, holiday, relative). Passwords must not under any circumstances be shared with anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

You warrant that all statements of fact in any comment you submit are true, and that any expression of opinion is your honestly held opinion on those facts, or that of the person on whose behalf you are writing.</p>

            <p>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In order to access certain content, systems or interactive features on this website you may be asked to choose, or be provided with, a password or other log in details to access parts of this website. As a minimum, passwords you set for use with this website must have a level of complexity which ensures they cannot be easily guessed by hackers or malicious software. &nbsp;They should:</p>

            <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;be at least twelve characters long;<br />
            •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;not contain your user name, real name, or organisation name;<br />
            •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;not appear in the list of top 10,000 passwords;<br />
            •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;not use sequential key characters on the keyboard (e.g. qwerty, asdfg, 12345)</p>

            <p>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In line with Government best practice, we recommend using the ‘three random words’ approach, which uses three or more randomly chosen words like ‘saloonbadgertree’ or ‘coffeetrainfish’. &nbsp;These words should be random, and not related personally to you (so not involving a favourite thing, holiday, relative). Passwords must not under any circumstances be shared with anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You may terminate your account registration using the relevant link in your account pages. This will clear any personal information you have saved. Subscriptions to our emails can be terminated using the ‘Unsubscribe’ links provided in the emails. &nbsp;<br />

You should not name any individuals (other than yourself) or include information through which someone else could identify an individual about whom you are writing. If you want to comment on someone else’s experience, (e.g. a relative or someone you care for) then you may do so if you ensure that you are not named in the posting and you state how the other person is connected to you (e.g. “my father”). You warrant that all statements of fact in any comment you submit are true, and that any expression of opinion is your honestly held opinion on those facts, or that of the person on whose behalf you are writing.</p>

            <p>9.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you find any comments offensive or objectionable you may make a complaint to the moderator using the ‘Report’ link provided at the foot of each published comment.</p>
