          <p><strong>Background</strong></p>

          <p>In October 2011 this collection of indicators brought together information that was previously available on two different websites; the Compendium of Clinical and Health Indicators and the Local Basket of Inequalities Indicators.</p>

          <p>If you previously used the Compendium of Clinical and Health Indicators website (also known as NCHOD) then please be aware that the Directory of Clinical Databases (DoCDat) and Patient Reported Outcome Measures Group resources are now located on other websites.</p>

          <p>For information about the contents of the Local Basket of Indicators please select the appropriate link from the list on the left.</p>

          <p><strong>What do the indicators cover?</strong></p>

          <p>There are over 1,000 indicators in this collection. They cover the following areas of interest:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Population and demography</li>
           <li>Births, conceptions, fertility, abortions</li>
           <li>Deaths, mortality, infant mortality and life expectancy</li>
           <li>Cancer screening, incidence, survival and death rates</li>
           <li>Circulatory and heart diseases</li>
           <li>Respiratory diseases</li>
           <li>Diabetes and other long term conditions</li>
           <li>Infectious diseases and immunisation</li>
           <li>Health status</li>
           <li>Lifestyle e.g. nutrition, smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity</li>
           <li>Health interventions and Primary Care</li>
           <li>Hospital care</li>
           <li>Home and Community support</li>
           <li>Socio-economic factors influencing health
           <ul>
            <li>Employment, poverty, homelessness, deprivation, crime</li>
            <li>Education</li>
           </ul>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The indicators can be viewed on a national basis and at a number of different regional and local levels including Strategic Health Authority, Primary Care Trust/Organisation, Region and Local Authority. Please note that not all indicators can be viewed at every level.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Access to the Compendium</strong></p>

          <p>This website (<a href="https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/" target="_blank">https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk</a>) is available for any user.</p>

          <p>If you are having difficulty finding what you need please contact us via&nbsp;<a href="mailto:enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk?subject=Indicator%20Portal">enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk</a>&nbsp;for help with your data requirement.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>How can I access the archive?</strong></p>

          <p>We have an archive of older Compendium files (going back very many years) which are available on request.</p>

          <p>Please use the "contact us" button on the top right and specify which indicator files you are interested in, and for which time periods. We will do our best to assist.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Classification and Search features</strong></p>

          <p>The Indicator Portal is hosting a number of indicators in addition to the Compendium e.g. SHMI. Users will be able to search across the entire portal and access all indicators for a subject.</p>

          <p>The indicators have been classified according to subject rather than type of indicator e.g. mortality / prevalence / incidence. This ensures that all indicators are classified in a consistent manner and a user browsing around a subject grouping will have access to other types of indicators outside of the Compendium.</p>

          <p>Further indicators will be added to the portal which may not necessarily be of a specific indicator type and designing the taxonomy around subject included them all.&nbsp; The portal enables keyword searching to support the user who is interested in specific attributes, for example indicator type. A user can therefore enter a search on 'mortality' and a list of all the mortality indicators will be returned, likewise a search on 'prevalence' would bring up all the prevalence indicators. Searches can be refined by adding key words e.g. "vaccination MMR".</p>

          <p>However, if you continue to experience difficulty finding what you need please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk?subject=Indicator%20Portal">contact us</a>&nbsp;for help with your data requirement.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>User Engagement and changes to functionality</strong></p>

          <p>Through the Compendium Advisory Group, that has representation from the NHS and DH, we have kept stakeholders involved in changes to the Compendium.</p>

          <p>The indicators have not been significantly reviewed for over six years and NHS Digital conducted an initial 6 month review on the Compendium in early 2012. The aim was to help shape strategy and direct the work in NHS Digital in developing the Compendium of Public Health Indicators products and services to meet changing customer demand. Through an online survey and telephone interviews, stakeholders and users were asked about their experience of using the Compendium and views on future data requirements.</p>

          <p>In response to users' comments a number of initial changes have been made:</p>

          <p><strong>• Improved keywords</strong></p>

          <p>The content of the current keyword database has been extensively reviewed. The aim was to improve the search function by increasing the number of keywords tagged. This should improve indicator access and reduce navigation time.</p>

          <p><strong>• Indicator List</strong></p>

          <p>To aid users in finding indicators there is a full indicator list, which can be downloaded, on the Indicator Portal homepage and on the Compendium homepage. This covers all indicators and not just those on the Compendium.</p>

          <p>From this list, users can filter on:-</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Indicator Portal code</li>
           <li>Indicator group (e.g. Compendium)</li>
           <li>Level 1 (e.g. Hospital care)</li>
           <li>Level 2 (e.g. Admissions)</li>
           <li>Indicator name</li>
           <li>Release date</li>
           <li>Next update expected</li>
          </ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>This indicator list has also been added to the section called 'Site Updates' on the Indicator Portal homepage, under the heading 'Indicator Portal news' which provides the release history of indicators- date, title and description.&nbsp;<a href="https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/webview/velocity?mode=documentation&amp;submode=catalog&amp;catalog=https%3A%2F%2F192.168.228.51%3A443%2Fobj%2FfCatalog%2FCatalog9" target="_blank">Site Updates</a></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Extra Guidance</strong></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Extra guidance for users on how to filter the indicator list and search is provided through the screenshot guide on the main page of the Indicator Portal.</p>

          <p><a href="https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/download/Indicator_Portal_userguide.pdf" target="_blank">http://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/download/Indicator_Portal_userguide.pdf</a></p>

          <p>User feedback will be used to prioritise other developments over the next 12 months and we continue to seek such feedback on the recent changes to the Indicator Portal.</p>

          <p>Users are also advised to utilise the following sections:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Additional reading</li>
           <li>Statistical methods and disclosure control</li>
           <li>Terms and conditions</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Future Developments</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We are in the process of updating the NHS Digital website in line with our new responsibilities under the proposed Health Act which will lead to improved access and functionality for the user. We will keep users informed about how these changes will affect the Compendium and the Indicator Portal as developments occur.</p>

          <p><strong>Background</strong></p>

          <p>In October 2011 this collection of indicators brought together information that was previously available on two different websites; the Compendium of Clinical and Health Indicators and the Local Basket of Inequalities Indicators.</p>

          <p>If you previously used the Compendium of Clinical and Health Indicators website (also known as NCHOD) then please be aware that the Directory of Clinical Databases (DoCDat) and Patient Reported Outcome Measures Group resources are now located on other websites.</p>

          <p>For information about the contents of the Local Basket of Indicators please select the appropriate link from the list on the left.</p>

          <p><strong>What do the indicators cover?</strong></p>

          <p>There are over 1,000 indicators in this collection. They cover the following areas of interest:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Population and demography</li>
           <li>Births, conceptions, fertility, abortions</li>
           <li>Deaths, mortality, infant mortality and life expectancy</li>
           <li>Cancer screening, incidence, survival and death rates</li>
           <li>Circulatory and heart diseases</li>
           <li>Respiratory diseases</li>
           <li>Diabetes and other long term conditions</li>
           <li>Infectious diseases and immunisation</li>
           <li>Health status</li>
           <li>Lifestyle e.g. nutrition, smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity</li>
           <li>Health interventions and Primary Care</li>
           <li>Hospital care</li>
           <li>Home and Community support</li>
           <li>Socio-economic factors influencing health
           <ul>
            <li>Employment, poverty, homelessness, deprivation, crime</li>
            <li>Education</li>
           </ul>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The indicators can be viewed on a national basis and at a number of different regional and local levels including Strategic Health Authority, Primary Care Trust/Organisation, Region and Local Authority. Please note that not all indicators can be viewed at every level.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Access to the Compendium</strong></p>

          <p>This website (<a href="https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/" target="_blank">https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk</a>) is available for any user.</p>

          <p>If you are having difficulty finding what you need please contact us via&nbsp;<a href="mailto:enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk?subject=Indicator%20Portal">enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk</a>&nbsp;for help with your data requirement.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>How can I access the archive?</strong></p>

          <p>We have an archive of older Compendium files (going back very many years) which are available on request.</p>

          <p>Please use the "contact us" button on the top right and specify which indicator files you are interested in, and for which time periods. We will do our best to assist.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Classification and Search features</strong></p>

          <p>The Indicator Portal is hosting a number of indicators in addition to the Compendium e.g. SHMI. Users will be able to search across the entire portal and access all indicators for a subject.</p>

          <p>The indicators have been classified according to subject rather than type of indicator e.g. mortality / prevalence / incidence. This ensures that all indicators are classified in a consistent manner and a user browsing around a subject grouping will have access to other types of indicators outside of the Compendium.</p>

          <p>Further indicators will be added to the portal which may not necessarily be of a specific indicator type and designing the taxonomy around subject included them all.&nbsp; The portal enables keyword searching to support the user who is interested in specific attributes, for example indicator type. A user can therefore enter a search on 'mortality' and a list of all the mortality indicators will be returned, likewise a search on 'prevalence' would bring up all the prevalence indicators. Searches can be refined by adding key words e.g. "vaccination MMR".</p>

          <p>However, if you continue to experience difficulty finding what you need please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk?subject=Indicator%20Portal">contact us</a>&nbsp;for help with your data requirement.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>User Engagement and changes to functionality</strong></p>

          <p>Through the Compendium Advisory Group, that has representation from the NHS and DH, we have kept stakeholders involved in changes to the Compendium.</p>

          <p>The indicators have not been significantly reviewed for over six years and NHS Digital conducted an initial 6 month review on the Compendium in early 2012. The aim was to help shape strategy and direct the work in NHS Digital in developing the Compendium of Public Health Indicators products and services to meet changing customer demand. Through an online survey and telephone interviews, stakeholders and users were asked about their experience of using the Compendium and views on future data requirements.</p>

          <p>In response to users' comments a number of initial changes have been made:</p>

          <p><strong>• Improved keywords</strong></p>

          <p>The content of the current keyword database has been extensively reviewed. The aim was to improve the search function by increasing the number of keywords tagged. This should improve indicator access and reduce navigation time.</p>

          <p><strong>• Indicator List</strong></p>

          <p>To aid users in finding indicators there is a full indicator list, which can be downloaded, on the Indicator Portal homepage and on the Compendium homepage. This covers all indicators and not just those on the Compendium.</p>

          <p>From this list, users can filter on:-</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Indicator Portal code</li>
           <li>Indicator group (e.g. Compendium)</li>
           <li>Level 1 (e.g. Hospital care)</li>
           <li>Level 2 (e.g. Admissions)</li>
           <li>Indicator name</li>
           <li>Release date</li>
           <li>Next update expected</li>
          </ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>This indicator list has also been added to the section called 'Site Updates' on the Indicator Portal homepage, under the heading 'Indicator Portal news' which provides the release history of indicators- date, title and description.&nbsp;<a href="https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/webview/velocity?mode=documentation&amp;submode=catalog&amp;catalog=https%3A%2F%2F192.168.228.51%3A443%2Fobj%2FfCatalog%2FCatalog9" target="_blank">Site Updates</a></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Extra Guidance</strong></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Extra guidance for users on how to filter the indicator list and search is provided through the screenshot guide on the main page of the Indicator Portal.</p>

          <p><a href="https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/download/Indicator_Portal_userguide.pdf" target="_blank">http://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/download/Indicator_Portal_userguide.pdf</a></p>

          <p>User feedback will be used to prioritise other developments over the next 12 months and we continue to seek such feedback on the recent changes to the Indicator Portal.</p>

          <p>Users are also advised to utilise the following sections:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Additional reading</li>
           <li>Statistical methods and disclosure control</li>
           <li>Terms and conditions</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Future Developments</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We are in the process of updating the NHS Digital website in line with our new responsibilities under the proposed Health Act which will lead to improved access and functionality for the user. We will keep users informed about how these changes will affect the Compendium and the Indicator Portal as developments occur.</p>
